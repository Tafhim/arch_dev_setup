arch_dev_setup
==============

Sets up most of my stuff for a dev environment

*What it does*
+ Sets up .dev domain name, automatic apache vhosts (virtual hosts)
+ Installs PHP
+ Installs mySQL ( + configuration )
+ Installs git
+ Installs phpMyAdmin ( + configuration )
+ Installs and configures Apache (httpd)
+ Installs Drush
+ Creates local workspace directories

*What it doesn't*
- Z shell not installed ( I'm planning of configuration with oh-my-zsh 
too )
- localhost points to nothing :p
- I'm planning on adding drush site creation scripts in future, InshaAllah
